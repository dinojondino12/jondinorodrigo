<h3>Who am I?</h3>
<p>Hello, my name is Jon Dino F. Rodrigo, and I am a 3rd year information technology student at Western Mindanao State University. I love learning how computers work, how they interact with the human world, and what makes them tick. I am excited to learn more about this field and continue contributing to the world around me through technology. I’ve always been passionate about learning new things, whether reading a book or watching a movie. I just can’t get enough of it! My most extensive interests include programming, photography, layout, and playing basketball. No matter what I’m doing at school or working on in my free time, you’ll always find me surrounded by books and computers.</p>
